            An online platform for markets in developing countries to sell surplus crops

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            According to the United Nations Food Programme, food supply chains of developing countries are majorly threatened by an inefficient distribution of resources. Concerned by the amount of food that is wasted in developing countries due to this unequal distribution, we decided to develop an accessible platform inspired by the popular North American application, Kijiji. Markets would be able to sell their excess crops to other villages while those facing a shortage would gain easy contact through our platform to purchase these otherwise wasted items. 

            ultimately ending hunger and reducing food waste. 

            <h3>What it does</h3>
                Cropcycle allows markets to sell their surplus of common agricultural products through postings, where they can list their price per kilogram and describe the details regarding their crops. Coincidently, buyers can create postings to request products in that they have a deficit. After creating a post, all users can browse through nearby offers on the “Buy” and “Sell” pages and acquire contact information to reach out to product listers. Through this platform, Cropcycle aims to balance the quantity of available food across the country and ensure that food does not go to waste.

            <h3>How we built it</h3>
                We brainstormed design drafts of our website and proceeded to prototype it using HTML and other languages.

            <h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
            We struggled to prioritize which features we could implement within the 24 hour timeframe. (MORE TO COME)

            <h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>
            Proud of the new skills that we learned
            We had a very multidisciplinary team but were able to play to our strengths and collaborate effectively together!

            <h3>What we learned</h3>
            So far, we learned how to use Jquery and bootstrap. We also recognize that teamwork (and communication) makes the dream work :’)

            <h3>What's next for Cropcycle</h3>
            Expand to other developing countries and their popular products
            Add ability for users to create a profile and edit postings
            Ensure ethical pricing measures
            Filter based on proximity, implementing map
