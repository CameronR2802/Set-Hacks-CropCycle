            An online platform for markets in developing countries to sell surplus crops or buy agricultural

            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            According to the United Nations Food Programme, food supply chains of developing countries are majorly threatened by an inefficient distribution of resources. Concerned by the amount of food that is wasted in developing countries due to this unequal distribution, we decided to develop an accessible platform that would connect village markets based on their crop demands. Markets would be able to sell their excess crops to other villages while those facing a shortage can easily gain contact information to purchase these otherwise wasted items. 
            
            ultimately ending hunger and reducing food waste. 
            
            <h3>What it does</h3>
                Cropcycle allows markets to sell their surplus of common agricultural products through postings, where they can list their price per kilogram and describe the details regarding their crops. Coincidently, buyers can create postings to request products in that they experience a shortage. After creating a post, all users can browse through nearby offers on the “Find a Buyer” and “Find a Seller” pages and acquire contact information to reach out to product listers. Through this platform, Cropcycle aims to balance the quantity of available crops across the nation and ensure that food does not go to waste.
            
            <h3>How we buil it</h3>
                We brainstormed design drafts of our website and proceeded to prototype it using HTML and other languages.
            
            <h3>Challenges we ran into</h3>
            We struggled to prioritize which features we could implement within the 24 hour timeframe. Although we would’ve liked to include more features such as allowing users to edit their postings and upload their own photos, we had to focus on other details first as we were still learning during the hackathon. Initially, our team was at a disadvantage because only two members were able to code but as the project progressed the other team members were able to leverage their skills in marketing and creative design to improve the entrepreneurial appeal of the project. 
            
            <h3>Accomplishments that we're proud of</h3>
            Proud of the new skills that we learned
            Most importantly, we’re proud that we were able to play to our strengths as a multidisciplinary team and collaborate effectively together! (Two coders, businessperson and creative person)  (we even got to see the sunrise together teehee)
            
            <h3>What we learned</h3>
            From developing Cropcycle, we learned how to use jquery and bootstrap to increase efficiency and style our platform. People start to sing and laugh hysterically when they are tired.
            
            <h3>What's next for Cropcycle</h3>
            Along with allowing users to edit their postings, the next steps for Cropcycle would be to expand to more developing countries and include their popular agricultural products. We also think it would be effective to have the ability to sort buyer and seller pages based on proximity, which would encourage more local market interactions. If access to a greater toolset, we would also like to integrate maps onto our website so that users can explore offers closest to them in a visually appealing manner. Finally, a future goal would be to scrape the web for reasonable market prices of the products to ensure ethical pricing measures between buyers and sellers.
